# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system is capable of recognizing various hand gestures in real-time, which can be used in different applications such as virtual reality, sign language translation, and human-computer interaction.

# System Requirements
1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. OpenCV
3. NumPy
4. TensorFlow or PyTorch
5. Scikit-learn
6. Matplotlib
7. Dataset
   
The dataset should consist of images of hand gestures, organized in subdirectories named after the gesture classes (e.g., thumbs_up, thumbs_down, peace). Ensure that the dataset is placed in the data directory before running the preprocessing script.

# Model Training
The model can be trained using either TensorFlow or PyTorch. The training script handles the training process, including data loading, model training, and saving the trained model.

# Evaluation
The model can be evaluated using the evaluation script. This script loads the trained model and evaluates its performance on the test dataset, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
